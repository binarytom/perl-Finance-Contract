=head1 NAME

Finance::Contract - represents a contract object for a single bet

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use feature qw(say);
    use Finance::Contract;
    # Create a simple contract
    my $contract = Finance::Contract->new(
        contract_type => 'CALLE',
        duration      => '5t',
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a generic abstraction for financial stock market contracts.

=head2 Construction

    Finance::Contract->new({
        underlying    => 'frxUSDJPY',
        contract_type => 'CALL',
        date_start    => $now,
        duration      => '5t',
        currency      => 'USD',
        payout        => 100,
        barrier       => 100,
    });

=head2 Dates

All date-related parameters:

=over 4

=item * L</date_pricing>

=item * L</date_expiry>

=item * L</date_start>

=back

are L<Date::Utility> instances. You can provide them as epoch values
or L<Date::Utility> objects.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

These are the parameters we expect to be passed when constructing a new contract.

=cut

=head2 bet_type

The type of this contract as an upper-case string.

Current types include:

=over 4

=item * C<CALL>

=item * C<PUT>

=item * C<CALLE>

=item * C<EXPIRYRANGE>

=item * C<EXPIRYMISS>

=item * C<DIGITMATCH>

=item * C<DIGITOVER>

=back

=cut

has bet_type => (
    is  => 'ro',
    isa => 'Str',
);

=head2 currency

The currency of the payout for this contract, e.g. C<USD>.

=cut

has currency => (
    is       => 'ro',
    isa      => 'Str',
    required => 1,
);

=head2 date_expiry

When the contract expires.

=cut

has date_expiry => (
    is => 'rw',
    @date_attribute,
);

=head2 date_pricing

The date at which we're pricing the contract. Provide C< undef > to indicate "now".

=cut

has date_pricing => (
    is => 'ro',
    @date_attribute,
);

=head2 date_start

For American contracts, defines when the contract starts.

For Europeans, this is used to determine the barrier when the requested barrier is relative.

=cut

has date_start => (
    is => 'ro',
    @date_attribute,
);

=head2 duration

The requested contract duration, specified as a string indicating value with units.
The unit is provided as a single character suffix:

=over 4

=item * t - ticks

=item * s - seconds

=item * m - minutes

=item * h - hours

=item * d - days

=back

Examples would be C< 5t > for 5 ticks, C< 3h > for 3 hours.

=cut

has duration => (is => 'ro');

=head2 is_forward_starting

True if this contract is considered as forward-starting at L</date_pricing>.

=cut

has is_forward_starting => (
    is         => 'ro',

    is         => 'ro',
    isa        => 'Num',
    lazy_build => 1,

Prediction (for tick trades) is what client predicted would happen.

=cut

has prediction => (
    is  => 'ro',
    isa => 'Maybe[Num]',
);

=head2 starts_as_forward_starting

This attribute tells us if this contract was initially bought as a forward starting contract.
This should not be mistaken for L</is_forward_starting> attribute as that could change over time.

=cut

has starts_as_forward_starting => (
    is      => 'ro',
    default => 0,
);

=head2 supplied_barrier_type

One of:

=over 4

=item * C<relative> - this is of the form C<< S10P >> or C<< S-4P >>, which would be 10 pips above the spot
or 4 pips below the spot.

=item * C<absolute> - this is a number that can be compared directly with the spot, e.g. C<< 103.45 >>.

=item * C<difference> - a numerical difference from the spot, can be negative, e.g. C<< -0.035 >>.

=back

=cut

has supplied_barrier_type => (is => 'ro');

=head2 supplied_high_barrier

For a 2-barrier contract, this is the high barrier string. The meaning of these barrier values is controlled by L</supplied_barrier_type>.

=head2 supplied_barrier

For a single-barrier contract, this is the barrier string.

=cut

=cut

has tick_expiry => (
    is      => 'ro',
    default => 0,
);

has remaining_time => (
    is         => 'ro',
    isa        => 'Time::Duration::Concise',
    lazy_build => 1,
);

=head2 underlying_symbol

The underlying asset, as a string (for example, C< frxUSDJPY >).

=cut

has xxx_underlying_symbol => (
    is  => 'ro',
    isa => 'Str',
);

# This is needed to determine if a contract is newly priced
# or it is repriced from an existing contract.
# Milliseconds matters since UI is reacting much faster now.
has _date_pricing_milliseconds => (
    is => 'rw',
);

=head1 ATTRIBUTES - From contract_types.yml
